# UFood Marketing Campaign Optimization

**Author:** Joel Martin

## 📘 Overview

This project analyzes UFood's customer and marketing data to derive actionable insights and improve the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), we identify spending behavior, campaign responsiveness, and the influence of demographics on customer engagement.

## 🧠 Key Findings

- Age 31–70 spends the most but accepts fewer campaigns.
- Customers with fewer children are more responsive to campaigns.
- Catalog users are highly receptive; store purchases dominate volume.
- Education does not significantly affect campaign behavior.
- Married, single, and cohabiting individuals are high spenders.

## ✅ Recommendations

- Focus campaign engagement efforts on ages 23–30 and 71–80.
- Target catalog for conversions, web/store for volume.
- Prioritize users with no or few children.
- Avoid over-segmentation by education level.
